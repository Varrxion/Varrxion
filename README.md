I’m a **Software Engineer** passionate about **Game Engine Development**, **Software Architecture**, and **AI / ML**. While most of my work is confidential, this GitHub showcases my **personal projects**—from simple algorithms to my own custom game engine.  

### ⚙️ **Interests**  
- **Game Engine Development** – 2D rendering, "realistic" physics, and game mechanics.  
- **Software Architecture** – Simplifying developer readability, keeping code generic, and avoiding unnecessary technical debt.  
- **AI / ML** – Neural networks and machine learning.
